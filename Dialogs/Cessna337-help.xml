See "Equipment/Fuel and Payload" menu to adjust aircraft weights. Being able to adjust the weight of each passenger, take a tip: The rear seats works fine with kids or baggage, it's not recomended to fly with 6 adult passengers, due to balance issues.
	
The Cessna 337 Skymaster has a constant-speed propeller; so, you can increase propeller pitch to get more airspeed, but with a loss of engine RPM and power.

About knobs, use scroll mouse for gross adjustments, and left-central buttons for fine tunning. When setting radio frequencies, the mouse scroll will adjust integral numbers, and buttons will tune decimals.

There is a (temporary) guide to the Navomatic 400A autopilot in Models/Instruments/Navomatic/NAVOMATIC-400A-README.
